# SpaceShooterTest


Just some code I was testing for a space shooter. V1 is my first test, 2 as the second and so on. Enjoy!

I use scons to compile this on Linux. So you need to run sudo apt install scons     to compile

You should already have SDL2 installed.

Left and right arrow keys to move and space bar to shoot.

You can change the values in the code to your liking

// Define bullet dimensions
const int BULLET_WIDTH = 9;
const int BULLET_HEIGHT = 21;
const int MAX_BULLETS = 15;

tate->bulletSpeed = 5;
state->fireRate = 50;  // Time between shots in milliseconds
state->fireCooldown = 0;



Thanks
