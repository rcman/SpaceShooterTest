# SpaceShooterTest


Just some code I was testing for a space shooter. V1 is my first test, 2 as the second and so on. Enjoy!

I use scons to compile this on Linux. So you need to run sudo apt install scons     to compile

You should already have SDL2 installed.

Left and right arrow keys to move and space bar to shoot.

Thanks
